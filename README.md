# Enjoy Data On Power Systems
## Notes
- Here are some codes on the analysis of Data from Power Systems. 
- All the datasets are provided by the Department of Electric Engineering, THU.
- I hate Python, especially Pandas and Numpy.. The Data Struct is too complex, compared with C families (JAVA,C#,C++,C,VB,etc..).

## Document
- There is a README in any Files in this depository, which introduces the code.
- The Ensemble of READMEs and More details in these codes is located in /Documents, Enjoy it.
